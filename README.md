# Final-Project
CS112: Statistical Inference course taught by Professor Alexis Diamond.

In this final project, the [Synthetic Control](https://www.nber.org/papers/w12831) method was used to evaluate the impact of Stand Your Ground (SYG) laws on Florida. This evaluation extends on [Humphrey et al.'s initial evaluation](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2582988) using an uninterrupted time series study. 

A synthetic Florida was created using non-SYG US states as a control group vs the real Florida.

This repository contains the synthetic control code, the data used in creating the synth, and a sample decision memo reporting our findings and recommended next steps. The final decision memo can be viewed in the file "Final-decision-memo.pdf"
